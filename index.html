Welcome to our new Summer Program. Since summer is coming soon for your children, our new program will benefit them. Here are our different options
<br><br>
<strong>One on One Tutoring:</strong>
<br><br>
If you want to sharpen you or your child's math skills or just get ready for next year, our tutoring option is for you. In our tutoring program, we create a plan that covers all the parts of a topic. To start, fill out our form or reach out to us via email. After explaining what help is needed, we will create an entrance test. Once this test is completed, we will create the lesson plan and reach out about a certain time for our tutoring sessions. We can use any video calling platform for them and can meet as many times a week as you wish and however long. This type of tutoring is good for any child as it is guaranteed to make a difference as our tested tutors will go at whatever pace your child can go at.
